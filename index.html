                    <p>Hello! I am a student in SDSU's class of 2026, and I am currently pursuing a Computer Science major. During my time here, I have become proficient developing in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I am heavily involved in the Machine Learning and AI sphere, where I have done research with SDSU's AI4Business lab and Real Time Embedded Systems lab. I have also been a CS instructor working with Lavner Education, equipping the next generation of students with foundational skills. </p>

                    <p><br>I am also involved with extracurriculars on campus where I competed in intramural volleyball and basketball, and also participated in workshops at our dedicated AI club at SDSU. Outside of work and school however, I enjoy playing basketball at the park and enjoying the rich asian flavors San Diego has to offer.</p>
